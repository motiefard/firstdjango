# firstdjango

This is a poll application built using **Django**, a high-level Python web framework.  
Throughout this project, I learned the creation of a basic poll application.
It consists of two parts:
    - A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
    - An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.
